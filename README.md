My personal R markdown template
===================

<br>

--> See it live [**here**](https://drwernicke.github.io/crthemes/).


<br><br>
Overview
--------
This is [a custom R Markdown template](https://drwernicke.github.io/crthemes/) for .Rmd reports. It is in large based on [**this**](https://holtzy.github.io/epuRate/) theme.

<br><br><br>
Using it
--------

- Install the R package:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("drwernicke/crthemes")
library(crthemes)
```
- Open a new rmd file in Rstudio: File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> epuRate.

- Change  the Header of your document with your name, email adress, github / twitter / linkedIn details if you want to display them. You can also add a logo over the table of content.

Stuff
--------
You need a fairly new version of pandoc to use google fonts.
